# Time-aware Personalized Graph Transformer

This code corresponds to the paper titled "Discovering Time-Aware Dependency in Electronic Health
Records through Personalized Hidden Graph Inference" It serves as a resource for understanding the development of THGT and the interconnections between layers in the deep learning architecture. By examining this code, one can gain insights into the implementation details and gain a comprehensive understanding of THGT's functionality.


## Documentation

This project consists of three files.
- *temporal_graph_convolutional_transformer.py*: This file provides insights into the neural network architecture specifically designed for three time steps. It outlines the structure and configuration of the network, offering a clear understanding of its inner workings.

- *utils.py*: In this file, you will find crucial information about the hyperparameters and evaluation metrics employed in the paper. It serves as a source for reproducing and comparing the results obtained in the study.

- *train.py*: This file encapsulates the training procedure for the neural network. Please note that the dataset and data processing files are not included. To conduct further research, developers are expected to provide their own dataset, ensuring that it aligns with the requirements of the project.
